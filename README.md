# Mars rover exercise

Live version: https://lucatorriani.it/mars-rover

To quickly spin up the project you can use the docker-compose.yml file included in the project like so:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If docker is not your thing, you can go into the **/frontend** folder and type:

```
npm run dev
```

And then go into the **/backend** folder and type:

```
npm run start:dev
```

Make sure that both port **:3000** and **:3001** are free before starup.
